## FAQ

### Q: Can I delete the downloads?
A: You can delete or move the download folder after Wabbajack is finished. However, when redownloading or updating the list Wabbajack will redownload *all* files that it can not find proper matches for, so consider this if you have slow internet, don't have nexus premium, or value your time in general.

### Q: What mod is it that makes favorited items/potions/quest items show on my character?
A: [Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001). You can open the menu with `Left Shift+Backspace` to customize what you want to show and what you don't want to show.

### Q: How do I reposition my weapons? / Can I have swords on my back?
A: Open the [Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001) GUI with `Left Shift + Backspace` and reposition your equipment.

### Q: How do I remove the Glenmoril Witch Head from showing on my character?
A: Open the [Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001) GUI with `Left Shift + Backspace`, under `Display Manager` click View > Custom items, look for `Quest - Left Skull`, scroll down to `Equipment overrides`, expand `Glenmoril Witch Head`, and under `General` tick the box next to `Disabled`.

### Q: How do I remove [Insert Quest Item] from showing on my character?
A: See above instructions.
